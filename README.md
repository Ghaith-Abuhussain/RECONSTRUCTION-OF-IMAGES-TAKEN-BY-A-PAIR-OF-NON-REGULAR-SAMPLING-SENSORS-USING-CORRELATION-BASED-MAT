# RECONSTRUCTION-OF-IMAGES-TAKEN-BY-A-PAIR-OF-NON-REGULAR-SAMPLING-SENSORS-USING-CORRELATION-BASED-MAT

Increasing spatial image resolution is a widely discussed area in the field of image processing. In this 
paper, we present an efficient reconstruction approach for high-resolution images, taken with irregularly 
shielded low-resolution sensors in a multi-view setup. The approach is based on the sparsity assumption, 
meaning that natural images can be efficiently represented in a transform-domain using only few 
coefficients. Utilizing information from adjacent cameras results in a better reconstruction quality for 
the central high-resolution view. Note that we consider that the effect of illumination is neglected 
between neighbouring camera
